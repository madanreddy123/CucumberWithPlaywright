Here is a visualization of the Selenium Grid setup on OpenShift pods:

- **OpenShift Cluster**: The large blue box represents the OpenShift cluster.
- **Selenium Hub Pod**: The green box within the cluster represents the Selenium Grid Hub, which coordinates the test execution.
- **Selenium Node Pods**: The orange boxes represent multiple Selenium Grid Node pods. These nodes are where the actual tests are executed across different browsers and environments.
- **Arrows**: The arrows illustrate the communication between the Hub and the Nodes, with the Hub distributing tests to the Nodes for parallel execution.

This setup demonstrates how Selenium Grid components can be containerized and managed within an OpenShift environment, allowing for scalable and efficient test automation.
